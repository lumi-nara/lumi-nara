##### ⚙️ How I Learn

I developed a systematic approach to AI-assisted learning that combines 
- pedagogical scaffolding with deliberate practice (from my teaching background) 
- AI as an adaptive tutor (not a code generator)  
- Systematic & modular thinking (structure before syntax)  



##### 🚀 What I'm Doing

- Currently developing a **user-ready, expandable & maintainable Python application** for image harmonization in batches.  
- Creating **meta-frameworks** for accelerated skill acquisition, ensuring a continuous learning curve  
- Writing **consistent documentation** that keeps both learning & work process aligned, transparent and easy to revisit. 



##### 💭 My Principles

- Code quality matters, even for beginners  
- Tests aren’t optional - they’re learning tools  
- AI should amplify human thinking, not replace it  
- The best way to learn is to build something real
